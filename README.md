# Rock, paper, scissors

This repository was made for a school project in Artificial intelligence and is a proof of concept for image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the help of the Keras machine learning framework.

## Setup

In order to run the scripts from this repository it is necessary to install the required dependencies. All of the dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed using `pip`. The easiest way to get started is making a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment:

- `conda create --name <env_name> python==3.8`
- `conda activate <env_name>`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
